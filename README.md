The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is a solution to manage vehicles that uses computer vision technology to automatically scan vehicle number plates without human intervention.Â 
ANPR system scans for passing cars, reads their number plates, and checks if the number is registered. If registered, the system allows the vehicle to pass; if not, the owner must register the vehicle with required information.
The project incorporates a real-time check-in feature that logs the time and car details in a CSV file, which can be downloaded. Additionally, it provides a list of registered vehicles.
